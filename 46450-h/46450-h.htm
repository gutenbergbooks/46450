<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
<p>The studies of the trees of North America (exclusive of Mexico) which have been carried
on by the agents and correspondents of the Arboretum in the sixteen years since the publication
of the <i>Manual of the Trees of North America</i> have increased the knowledge of
the subject and made necessary a new edition of this <i>Manual</i>. The explorations of these
sixteen years have added eighty-nine species of trees and many recently distinguished
varieties of formerly imperfectly understood species to the silva of the United States, and
made available much additional information in regard to the geographical distribution of
American trees. Further studies have made the reduction of seven species of the first edition
to varieties of other species seem desirable; and two species, <i>Amelanchier obovalis</i> and
<i>Cercocarpus parvifolius</i>, which were formerly considered trees, but are more properly
shrubs, are omitted. The genus Anamomis is now united with Eugenia; and the Arizona
<i>Pinus strobiformis</i> Sarg. (not Engelm.) is now referred to <i>Pinus flexilis</i> James.</p>
<p>Representatives of four Families and sixteen Genera which did not appear in the first
edition are described in the new edition in which will be found an account of seven hundred
and seventeen species of trees in one hundred and eighty-five genera, illustrated by seven
hundred and eighty-three figures, or one hundred and forty-one figures in addition to those
which appeared in the first edition.</p>
<p>An International Congress of Botanists which assembled in Vienna in 1905, and again in
Brussels in 1910, adopted rules of nomenclature which the world, with a few American exceptions,
has now generally adopted. The names used in this new <i>Manual</i> are based on
the rules of this International Congress. These are the names used by the largest number
of the students of plants, and it is unfortunate that the confusion in the names of American
trees must continue as long as the Department of Agriculture, including the Forest Service
of the United States, uses another and now generally unrecognized system.</p>
<p>The new illustrations in this edition are partly from drawings made by Charles Edward
Faxon, who died before his work was finished; it was continued by the skillful pencil of
Mary W. Gill, of Washington, to whom I am grateful for her intelligent co&ouml;peration.</p>
<p>It is impossible to name here all the men and women who have in the last sixteen years
contributed to this account of American trees, and I will now only mention Mr. T. G. Harbison
and Mr. E. J. Palmer, who as agents of the Arboretum have studied for years the
trees of the Southeastern States and of the Missouri-Texas region, Professor R. S. Cocks, of
Tulane University, who has explored carefully and critically the forests of Louisiana, and
Miss Alice Eastwood, head of the Botanical Department of the California Academy of
Sciences, who has made special journeys in Alaska and New Mexico in the interest of this
<i>Manual</i>. Mr. Alfred Rehder, Curator of the Herbarium of the Arboretum, has added to
the knowledge of our trees in several Southern journeys; and to him I am specially indebted
for assistance and advice in the preparation of the keys to the different groups of plants
found in this volume.</p>
<p>This new edition of the <i>Manual</i> contains the results of forty-four years of my continuous
study of the trees of North America carried on in every part of the United States and in
many foreign countries. If these studies in any way serve to increase the knowledge
and the love of trees I shall feel that these years have not been misspent.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>In this volume I have tried to bring into convenient form for the use of students the information
concerning the trees of North America which has been gathered at the Arnold
Arboretum during the last thirty years and has been largely elaborated in my <i>Silva of
North America</i>.</p>
<p>The indigenous trees of no other region of equal extent are, perhaps, so well known as
those that grow naturally in North America. There is, however, still much to be learned
about them. In the southern states, one of the most remarkable extratropical regions in
the world in the richness of its arborescent flora, several species are still imperfectly known,
while it is not improbable that a few may have escaped entirely the notice of botanists; and
in the northern states are several forms of Crat&aelig;gus which, in the absence of sufficient information,
it has been found impracticable to include in this volume. Little is known as
yet of the silvicultural value and requirements of North American trees, or of the diseases
that affect them; and one of the objects of this volume is to stimulate further investigation
of their characters and needs.</p>
<p>The arrangement of families and genera adopted in this volume is that of Engler &amp;
Prantl&rsquo;s <i>Die Nat&uuml;rlichen Pflanzenfamilien</i>, in which the procession is from a simpler to a
more complex structure. The nomenclature is that of <i>The Silva of North America</i>. Descriptions
of a few species of Crat&aelig;gus are now first published, and investigations made
since the publication of the last volume of <i>The Silva of North America</i>, in December, 1902,
have necessitated the introduction of a few additional trees described by other authors, and
occasional changes of names.</p>
<p>An analytical key to the families, based on the arrangement and character of the leaves,
will lead the reader first to the family to which any tree belongs; a conspectus of the genera,
embodying the important and easily discovered contrasting characters of each genus and
following the description of each family represented by more than one genus, will lead him
to the genus he is trying to determine; and a similar conspectus of the species, following the
description of the genus, will finally bring him to the species for which he is looking. Further
to facilitate the determination, one or more letters, attached to the name of the species
in the conspectus following the description of the genus, indicate in which of the eight regions
into which the country is divided according to the prevailing character of the arborescent
vegetation that species grows (see <a href="#c1">map</a> forming frontispiece of the volume). For
example, the northeastern part of the country, including the high Appalachian Mountains
in the southern states which have chiefly a northern flora, is represented by (A), and a person
wishing to learn the name of a Pine-tree or of an Oak in that region need occupy himself
only with those species which in the conspectus of the genus Quercus or Pinus are
followed by the letter (A), while a person wishing to determine an Oak or a Pine-tree in
Oregon or California may pass over all species which are not followed by (G), the letter
which represents the Pacific coast region south of the state of Washington.</p>
<p>The sign of degrees (&deg;) is used in this work to represent feet, and the sign of minutes (&prime;)
inches.</p>
<p>The illustrations which accompany each species and important variety are one half the
size of nature, except in the case of a few of the large Pine cones, the flowers of some of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
Magnolias, and the leaves and flower-clusters of the Palms. These are represented as less
than half the size of nature in order to make the illustrations of uniform size. These illustrations
are from drawings by Mr. Faxon, in which he has shown his usual skill and experience
as a botanical draftsman in bringing out the most important characters of each species,
and in them will be found the chief value of this Manual. For aid in its preparation I am
indebted to him and to my other associates, Mr. Alfred Rehder and Mr. George R. Shaw,
who have helped me in compiling the most difficult of the keys.</p>

of summer cells impregnated with resin, pale nearly white sapwood, and large branch-buds
formed during summer and composed of minute buds in the axils of bud-scales,
becoming the bracts of the spring shoot. Leaves needle-shaped, clustered, the clusters
borne on deciduous spurs in the axils of scale-like primary leaves, inclosed in the bud
by numerous scales lengthening and forming a more or less persistent sheath at the base
of each cluster. Male flowers clustered at the base of leafy growing shoots of the year,
each flower surrounded at the base by an involucre of 3&mdash;6 scale-like bracts, composed
of numerous sessile anthers, imbricated in many ranks and surmounted by crest-like
nearly orbicular connectives; the female subterminal or lateral, their scales in the axils of
non-accrescent bracts. Fruit a woody cone maturing at the end of the second or rarely
of the third season, composed of the hardened and woody scales of the flower more or
less thickened on the exposed surface (the <i>apophysis</i>), with the ends of the growth of the previous
year appearing as terminal or dorsal brown protuberances or scars (the <i>umbo</i>). Seeds
usually obovoid, shorter or longer than their wings or rarely wingless; outer seed-coat
crustaceous or thick, hard, and bony, the inner membranaceous; cotyledons 3&mdash;18, usually
much shorter than the inferior radicle.</p>
<p class="tree">Pinus is widely distributed through the northern hemisphere from the Arctic Circle
to the West Indies, the mountains of Central America, the Canary Islands, northern
Africa, the Philippine Islands, and Sumatra. About sixty-six species are recognized. Of
exotic species the so-called Scotch Pine, <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L., of Europe and Asia, the Swiss
Stone Pine, <i>Pinus cembra</i> L., and the Austrian Pine and other forms of <i>Pinus nigra</i>
Arnold, from central and southern Europe, are often planted in the northeastern states,
and <i>Pinus Pinaster</i> Ait., of the coast region of western France and the Mediterranean
Basin is successfully cultivated in central and southern California. <i>Pinus</i> is the classical
name of the Pine-tree.</p>

thin pale sapwood, slender remote horizontal often pendulous branches, elongated leading
branchlets, short thick spur-like lateral branchlets, and small subglobose buds, their inner
scales accrescent and marking the lateral branchlets with prominent ring-like scars.
Leaves awl-shaped, triangular and rounded above, or rarely 4-angled, spirally disposed
and remote on leading shoots, on lateral branchlets in crowded fascicles, each leaf in the
axil of a deciduous bud-scale, deciduous. Flowers solitary, terminal, the staminate globose,
oval or oblong, sessile or stalked, on leafless branches, yellow, composed of numerous
spirally arranged anthers with connectives produced above them into short points, the
pistillate appearing with the leaves, short-oblong to oblong, composed of few or many
green nearly orbicular stalked scales in the axes of much longer mucronate usually scarlet
bracts. Fruit a woody ovoid-oblong conic or subglobose short-stalked cone composed of
slightly thickened suborbicular or oblong-obovate concave scales, shorter or longer than
their bracts, gradually decreasing from the centre to the ends of the cone, the small scales
usually sterile. Seeds nearly triangular, rounded on the sides, shorter than their wings;
the outer seed-coat crustaceous, light brown, the inner membranaceous, pale chestnut-brown

<p class="tree">Pyramidal trees, with thick deeply furrowed bark, hard strong wood, with spirally
marked wood-cells, slender usually horizontal irregularly whorled branches clothed with
slender spreading lateral branches forming broad flat-topped masses of foliage, ovoid acute
leaf-buds, the lateral buds in the axils of upper leaves, their inner scales accrescent and
marking the branchlets with ring-like scars. Leaves petiolate, linear, flat, rounded and
obtuse or acuminate at apex, straight or incurved, grooved on the upper side, marked
on the lower side by numerous rows of stomata on each side of the prominent midrib,
spreading nearly at right angles with the branch. Flowers solitary, the male axillary,
scattered along the branches, oblong-cylindric, with numerous globose anthers, their connectives
terminating in short spurs, the female terminal or in the axils of upper leaves,
composed of spirally arranged ovate rounded scales much shorter than their acutely 2-lobed
bracts, with midribs produced into elongated slender tips. Fruit an ovoid-oblong acute
pendulous cone maturing in one season, with rounded concave rigid scales persistent on
the axis of the cone after the escape of the seeds, and becoming dark red-brown, much
shorter than the 2-lobed bracts with midribs ending in rigid woody linear awns, those at the
base of the cone without scales and becoming linear-lanceolate by the gradual suppression
of their lobes. Seeds nearly triangular, full, rounded and dark-colored on the upper side
and pale on the lower side, shorter than their oblong wings infolding the upper side of the
seeds in a dark covering; outer seed-coat thick and crustaceous, the inner thin and membranaceous;
cotyledons 6&mdash;12, much shorter than the inferior radicle.</p>

<p class="tree">Yucca is confined to the New World and is distributed from Bermuda and the eastern
Antilles, through the south Atlantic and Gulf states to Oklahoma and Arkansas, and
through New Mexico and northward along the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains to
South Dakota, westward to middle California, and southward through Arizona, Mexico,
and Lower California to Central America. About thirty species with many varieties
and probable hybrids are recognized. Of the species which inhabit the territory of the
United States nine assume the habit and attain the size of small trees. The root-stalks
of Yucca are used as a substitute for soap, and ropes, baskets, and mats are made from
the tough fibres of the leaves. Many of the species are cultivated, especially in countries
of scanty rainfall, for their great clusters of beautiful flowers, or in hedges to protect gardens
from cattle.</p>

Japan in the Old World. Of the thirty-four species now generally recognized fifteen are
found in North America. The wood of many of the American species is employed in large
quantities for paper-making, and several species furnish wood used in construction and in
the manufacture of small articles of wooden ware. The bark contains tannic acid and is
used in tanning leather and occasionally as a tonic, and the fragrant balsam contained in
the buds of some species is occasionally used in medicine. The rapidity of their growth,
their hardiness and the ease with which they can be propagated by cuttings, make many of
the species useful as ornamental trees or in wind-breaks, although planted trees often suffer
severely from the attacks of insects boring into the trunks and branches. Of the exotic
species, the Abele, or White Poplar, <i>Populus alba</i> L., of Europe and western Asia, and its
fastigiate form, and the so-called Lombardy Poplar, a tree of pyramidal habit and a form
of the European and Asiatic <i>Populus nigra</i> L., and one of its hybrids, have been largely

<p class="tree">Betula is widely distributed from the Arctic circle to Texas in the New World, and to
southern Europe, the Himalayas, China, and Japan in the Old World, some species forming
great forests at the north, or covering high mountain slopes. Of the twenty-eight or
thirty species now recognized twelve are found in North America; of these nine are trees.
Of exotic species the European and Asiatic <i>Betula pendula</i> Roth. in a number of forms is a
common ornamental tree in the northern states, where several of the Birch-trees of eastern
Asia also flourish. Many of the species produce wood valued by the cabinet-maker, or used
in the manufacture of spools, shoe-lasts, and other small articles. The thin layers of the
bark are impervious to water and are used to cover buildings, and for shoes, canoes, and
boxes. The sweet sap provides an agreeable beverage.</p>
<p class="tree"><i>Betula</i> is the classical name of the Birch-tree.</p>

<p class="tree">Alnus inhabits swamps, river bottom-lands, and high mountains, and is widely and generally
distributed through the northern hemisphere, often forming the most conspicuous
feature of vegetation on mountain slopes, ranging at high altitudes southward in the New
World through Central America to Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, and to upper Assam and
Japan in the Old World. Of the eighteen or twenty species now recognized nine are North
American; of these, six attain the size and habit of trees. Of the exotic species, <i>Alnus
vulgaris</i> Hill., a common European, north African, and Asiatic timber-tree, was introduced
many years ago into the northeastern states, where it has become locally naturalized.
The wood of Alnus is very durable in water, and the astringent bark and strobiles are used
in tanning leather and in medicine.</p>

opening in early summer, unisexual, strong-smelling; the staminate, in 3&mdash;7-flowered cymes,
in the axils of minute ovate bracts, in elongated simple deciduous aments first appearing
with the unfolding of the leaves from the inner scales of the terminal bud and from the
axils of the lower leaves of the year, composed of a pale straw-colored slightly puberulous
calyx deeply divided into 6 ovate rounded segments imbricated in the bud, and 10&mdash;20
stamens inserted on the slightly thickened torus, with filiform filaments incurved in the
bud, becoming elongated and exserted, and ovoid or globose pale yellow anthers; the pistillate
scattered or spicate at the base of the shorter persistent androgynous aments from the
axils of later leaves, sessile, 2 or 3 together or solitary within a short-stemmed or sessile
involucre of closely imbricated oblong acute bright green bracts scurfy-pubescent or tomentose
below the middle, subtended by a bract and 2 lateral bractlets, each flower composed
of an urn-shaped calyx, with a short limb divided into 6 obtuse lobes, minute sterile
stamens shorter than the calyx-lobes, an ovary 6-celled after fecundation, with 6 linear
spreading white styles hairy below the middle and tipped by minute acute stigmas, and 2
ovules in each cell, attached on its inner angle, descending, semianatropous. Fruit maturing
in one season, its involucre inclosing 1&mdash;3 nuts, globose or short-oblong, pubescent or
tomentose and spiny on the outer surface, with elongated ridged bright green ultimately
brown branched spines fascicled between the deciduous scales, coated on the inner surface
with lustrous pubescence, splitting at maturity into 2&mdash;4 valves; nut ovoid, acute, crowned
by the remnants of the style, bright chestnut-brown and lustrous, tomentose or pubescent
at apex, cylindrical, or when more than 1 flattened, marked at the broad base by a large
conspicuous pale circular or oval thickened scar, its shell lined with rufous or hoary tomentum.
Seed usually solitary by abortion, dark chestnut-brown, marked at apex by the
abortive ovules, with thick and fleshy more or less undulate ruminate sweet farinaceous
cotyledons.</p>
<p class="tree">Castanea is confined to the northern hemisphere, and is widely distributed through eastern
North America, southern Europe, northern Africa, southwestern Asia, and central and
northern China, Korea, and Japan. Seven species are distinguished. In the countries of
the Mediterranean Basin much attention has been given to improving the fruit of the native
species <i>Castanea sativa</i> Mill., which is occasionally planted in the middle United States;
in Japan the seeds of <i>Castanea crenata</i> S. &amp; Zucc. in many varieties and in China those of
<i>Castanea mollissima</i> Bl. are important articles of food. Castanea produces coarse-grained
wood very durable in contact with the soil, and rich in tannin. Chestnut-trees suffer in
the eastern United States from the attacks of a fungus, <i>Endothia parasitica</i> Anders. which
has nearly exterminated them in many parts of the country.</p>
<p class="tree"><i>Castanea</i> is the classical name of the Chestnut-tree.</p>

<p class="tree"><b>Distribution.</b> Valley of the Umpqua River, Oregon, southward through the coast
ranges to the Santa Inez Mountains, California, and along the western slope of the Sierra
Nevada up to elevations of 4000&deg; above the sea to Mariposa County; very abundant in
the humid coast region north of San Francisco Bay and on the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia
Mountains, and of its largest size in the Redwood forest of Napa and Mendocino Counties;
southward and on the Sierras less abundant and of smaller size; the form <i>lanceolata</i> in
southern Oregon and in Del Norte and Mendocino Counties, California; the var. <i>montana</i>
at high altitudes on the Siskiyou Mountains, in the region of Mount Shasta and on the
northern Sierra Nevada.</p>
<h3 id="g_Quercus" class="genus">5. QUERCUS L. Oak.</h3>
<p class="tree">Trees or shrubs, with astringent properties, pubescence of fascicled hairs, scaly or dark and
furrowed bark, hard and close-grained or porous brittle wood, slender branchlets marked
by pale lenticels and more or less prominently 5-angled. Winter-buds clustered at the
ends of the branchlets, with numerous membranaceous chestnut-brown slightly accrescent
caducous scales closely imbricated in 5 ranks, in falling marking the base of the
branchlet with ring-like scars. Leaves 5-ranked, lobed, dentate or entire, often variable on
the same branch, membranaceous or coriaceous, the primary veins prominent and extending
to the margins or united within them and connected by more or less reticulate veinlets,
deciduous in the autumn or persistent until spring or until their third or fourth year;
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
petioles in falling leaving slightly elevated semiorbicular more or less obcordate leaf-scars
broader than high, marked by the ends of numerous scattered fibro-vascular bundles;
stipules obovate to lanceolate, scarious, caducous, or those of upper leaves occasionally
persistent through the season. Flowers vernal with or after the unfolding of the leaves;
staminate solitary in the axils of lanceolate acute caducous bracts, or without bracts, in
graceful pendulous clustered aments, from separate or leaf-buds in the axils of leaves of the
previous year, or from the axils of the inner scales of the terminal bud or from those of the
leaves of the year; calyx campanulate, lobed or divided to the base into 4&mdash;7, usually 6,
membranaceous lobes; stamens 4&mdash;6, rarely 2, or 10&mdash;12, inserted on the slightly thickened
torus, with free filiform exserted filaments and ovate-oblong or subglobose glabrous or rarely
hairy 2-celled usually yellow anthers; pistillate solitary, subtended by a caducous bract
and 2 bractlets, in short or elongated few-flowered spikes from the axils of leaves of the year;
calyx urn-shaped, with a short campanulate 6-lobed limb, the tube adnate to the incompletely
3 or rarely 4 or 5-celled ovary inclosed more or less completely by an accrescent involucre
of imbricated scales, becoming the cup of the fruit; styles as many as the cells of
the ovary, short or elongated, erect or incurved, dilated above, stigmatic on the inner face or
at apex only, generally persistent on the fruit; ovules anatropous or semianatropous, 2 in each
cell. Fruit a nut (<i>acorn</i>) maturing in one or in two years, ovoid, subglobose, or turbinate,
short-pointed at apex, 1-seeded by abortion, marked at base by a large conspicuous circular
scar, with a thick shell, glabrous or coated on the inner surface with pale tomentum,
more or less surrounded or inclosed in the accrescent cupular involucre of the flower (<i>cup</i>),
its scales thin or thickened, loosely or closely imbricated. Seed marked at base or at
apex or rarely on the side by the abortive ovules; cotyledons thick and fleshy, usually
plano-convex and entire.</p>
<p class="tree">Quercus inhabits the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and high altitudes
within the tropics, ranging in the New World southward to the mountains of Colombia
and in the Old World to the Indian Archipelago. Two hundred and seventy-five species
have been described; of the North American species fifty-four are large or small trees.
Of exotic species, the European <i>Quercus Robur</i> L., and <i>Quercus sessiliflora</i> Salisb., have been
frequently cultivated as ornamental trees in the eastern United States, where, however,
they are usually short-lived and unsatisfactory. Many of the species are important
timber-trees; their bark is often rich in tannin and is used for tanning leather, and all produce
wood valuable for fuel and in the manufacture of charcoal.</p>

<i>Quercus stellata</i> is one of the most variable of North American Oaks in habit, in the nature
of the bark, and in the presence or absence of pubescence. Some of the best marked varieties
are var. <i>araniosa</i> Sarg., a large tree differing from the type in the usually smooth
upper surface of the leaves, in the floccose persistent tomentum on their lower surface,
in the less stout usually glabrous yellow or reddish branchlets, and in its scaly bark; dry
sandy soil, southern Alabama, western Louisiana, southern Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma and
eastern Texas. Var. <i>paludosa</i> Sarg., a tree up to 75&deg; in height, differing from the type in its
oblong-obovate leaves 3-lobed above the middle, slightly pubescent branchlets becoming
nearly glabrous, and in its scaly bark; in rich deep soil on the often inundated bottoms of
Kenison Bayou, near Washington, St. Landry Parish, Louisiana. Var. <i>attenuata</i> Sarg.,
a large tree differing from the type in the oblong to oblong-obovate narrow leaves 3-lobed
at apex and gradually narrowed to the long cuneate base; near Arkansas Post on the White
River, Arkansas County, Arkansas. Var. <i>parviloba</i> Sarg., a round-topped tree 25&deg;&mdash;30&deg;
high, differing from the type in the smaller lobes of the leaves with more prominent reticulate
veinlets; dry sandstone hills near Brownwood, Brown County, Texas. Var. <i>anomala</i>
Sarg., a tree 15&deg;&mdash;18&deg; high, differing from the type in its broadly obovate subcoriaceous
leaves slightly 3-lobed and rounded at apex; dry sandstone hills near Brownwood, Brown
County, Texas; possibly a hybrid. Var. <i>Palmeri</i> Sarg., a shrub 6&deg;&mdash;15&deg; high, forming clumps,
differing from the type in its narrow oblong or slightly obovate 5&mdash;7-lobed leaves with
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
narrow lobes, densely tomentose below, and in the thicker and more tomentose scales of
the cup; sandy uplands, Elk City, Beckham County, Oklahoma. Var. <i>rufescens</i> Sarg., a
shrub 12&deg;&mdash;15&deg; high, forming large clumps, differing from the type in the rusty brown
pubescence on the lower surface of the polymorphous leaves, in the deeper cups of the
fruit with thicker basal scales; sandy uplands, Big Spring, Howard County, Texas, and Elk
City, Beckham County, Oklahoma. Var. <i>Boyntonii</i> Sarg., a shrub or small tree spreading
into thickets, rarely more than 15&deg; in height, differing from the type in its obovate leaves,
mostly 3&mdash;5-lobed toward the apex, with small rounded lobes, and in their yellow-brown
pubescence also found on the branchlets; in glades on the summit of Lookout Mountain,
above Gadsden and Attala, Etowah County, Alabama.</p>

<p class="tree">Ulmus, with eighteen or twenty species, is widely distributed through the boreal and
temperate regions of the northern hemisphere with the exception of western North America,
reaching in the New World the mountains of southern Mexico and in the Old World
the Sikkim Himalaya, western China, and Japan. Of the exotic species, <i>Ulmus procera</i>
Salisb., the so-called English Elm, and <i>Ulmus glabra</i>, Huds., the Scotch Elm, and several of
its varieties, have been largely planted for shade and ornament in the north Atlantic
states, where old and large specimens of the former can be seen, especially in the neighborhood
of Boston.</p>
<p class="tree">Ulmus produces heavy, hard, tough, light-colored wood, often difficult to split. The

<span class="pb" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
western Asia, Indo-China, China, Japan, the Bonin Islands and the mountains of the Indian
Archipelago. Two species occur in North America. The most valuable species, <i>Morus
alba</i> L., a native of China and Formosa, and largely cultivated in many countries for
its leaves, which are the best food of the silkworm, has been planted in large quantities
in the eastern United States; and <i>Morus nigra</i> L., probably a native of Persia, has been
introduced into the southern and Pacific states for its large dark-colored juicy fruit. Morus
produces straight-grained durable light brown or orange-colored valuable wood, and
sweet acidulous and refreshing fruits.</p>

<p class="tree">Crat&aelig;gus is most abundant in eastern North America, where it is distributed from Newfoundland
to the mountains of northern Mexico, and is represented by a large number of
arborescent and shrubby species. A few species occur in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific-coast
regions, and in China, Japan, Siberia, central and southwestern Asia, and in Europe.
The genus is still very imperfectly known in North America, and in the absence of sufficient
information concerning them several arborescent species are necessarily excluded from the
following enumeration. The beautiful and abundant flowers and showy fruits make many
of the species desirable ornaments of parks and gardens, and several are cultivated. Of
exotic species, the Old World <i>Crat&aelig;gus Oxyacantha</i> L., and <i>C. monogyna</i> Jacq., early introduced
into the United States as hedge plants, have now become naturalized in many places
in the northeastern and middle states. Crat&aelig;gus produces heavy hard tough close-grained
red-brown heartwood and thick lighter colored usually pale sapwood; useful for
the handles of tools, mallets, and other small articles.</p>
<p class="tree">The number of the stamens, although it differs on the same species within certain usually
constant limits, and the color of the anthers, which appears to be specifically constant with
one exception, afford the most satisfactory characters for distinguishing the species in
the different groups.</p>

Several of the species produce valuable wood, and from the pods and flower-buds of the
Chinese <i>Sophora japonica</i> L., a dye is obtained used to dye white cloth yellow and blue
cloth green. This tree is often cultivated as an ornament of parks and gardens in northern
China, Japan, the eastern United States, and in western, central, and southern Europe.</p>

<h3 id="g_Rhus" class="genus">4. RHUS L.</h3>
<p class="tree">Trees or shrubs, with pithy branchlets, fleshy roots, and milky sometimes caustic or
watery juice. Leaves unequally pinnate, or rarely simple. Flowers mostly di&oelig;cious,
rarely polygamous, white or greenish white, in more or less compound axillary or terminal
panicles, the staminate and pistillate usually produced on separate plants; calyx-lobes
united at base only, generally persistent; disk surrounding the base of the free ovary, coherent

<p class="tree">Rhus is widely distributed, with more than one hundred species, in the extra-tropical
regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. In North America the genus is widely
and generally distributed from Canada to southern Mexico and from the shores of the
Atlantic to those of the Pacific Ocean, with sixteen or seventeen species within the territory
of the United States. Of these, four obtain the habit of small trees. The acrid poisonous
juice of <i>Rhus vernicifera</i> DC., of China, furnishes the black varnish used in China and
Japan in the manufacture of lacquer, and other species are valued for the tannin contained
in their leaves or for the wax obtained from their fruit.</p>

<p class="tree">Sapindus is widely distributed through the tropics, especially in Asia, occasionally extending
into colder regions. About forty species have been distinguished; of these three
are found within the territory of the United States.</p>
<p class="tree">Sapindus contains a detersive principle which causes the pulp of the fruit to lather in
water, and makes it valuable as a substitute for soap. The bark, which is bitter and astringent,
has been used as a tonic. The seeds of several of the species are strung for chaplets
and bracelets and are used as buttons.</p>
<p class="tree">The generic name, from <i>sapo</i> and <i>Indus</i>, refers to the detersive properties and use of the
first species known to Europeans, a native of the West Indies.</p>

<p class="tree">Tilia with some thirty species is widely distributed in the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere with the exception of western America, central Asia, and the Himalayas.
Tilia produces soft straight-grained pale-colored light wood, largely used for the interior
finish of buildings, in cabinet-making, for the sounding-boards of pianos, wood-carving and
wooden ware, and in the manufacture of paper. The tough inner bark is largely manufactured
into mats, cords, fish-nets, coarse cloths, and shoes. Lime-flower oil, obtained by
distilling the flowers of the European species, is used in perfumery. The flowers yield
large quantities of nectar, and honey made near forests of Tilia is unsurpassed in flavor and
delicacy. Many of the species are planted as shade and ornamental trees, and some of
the European species are now common in the gardens and parks of the eastern United
States.</p>

Brazil, and Argentina, the largest number of species occurring near the boundary of the
United States and Mexico. Of the species of the United States at least three attain the
size and habit of small trees. Cochineal is derived from a scale-insect which feeds on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_760">[760]</span>
juices of some of the Mexican species, and the fruit of several species is refreshing and is consumed
in considerable quantities in semitropical countries. The large-growing species with
flat branches are employed in many countries to form hedges for the protection of gardens
and fields; and the branches saturated with watery juice are sometimes stripped of their
spines and bristles and fed to cattle.</p>

<p class="tree">Rhizophora with three species is widely and generally distributed on the shores of tidal
marshes in the tropical regions of the two hemispheres, one specie reaching those of
southern Florida. It possesses astringent properties; the bark has been used in tanning
leather, in dyeing, and as a febrifuge. The wood is hard, durable, and dark-colored.
By means of the aerial germination of its seeds and in its power to develop roots
from trunks and branches, Rhizophora is especially adapted to maintain itself on low tidal
shores and is an important factor in protecting and extending them into the ocean. Roots
springing from the stems at a considerable distance above the ground and arching outward
descend into the water and fix themselves in the mud beneath, while roots growing down
from the branches enter the ground and gradually thicken into stems. The fully grown
radicle ready to put forth roots and leaves, and often 10&prime;&mdash;12&prime; long, is thicker and heavier
at the root end than at the other, and in detaching itself from the cotyledons and in falling
the heavy end sticks in the mud, while the plumule at the other end, held above the shallow
surface of the water, soon unfolds its leaves.</p>

northern hemisphere, and south of the equator is represented in Peru by a single species.
Of the sixteen or seventeen species of the United States four are arborescent. Cornus is
rich in tannic acid, and the bark and occasionally the leaves and unripe fruit are used as
tonics, astringents, and febrifuges. Of exotic species, <i>Cornus mas</i>, L., is often planted in
the eastern states as an ornamental tree, and its edible fruit is used in Europe in preserves
and cordials. The wood of Cornus is hard, close-grained, and durable, and is used in
turnery and for charcoal.</p>

bracts, in many-flowered crowded fascicles in the axils of existing leaves or from the
leafless nodes of previous years; calyx ovoid to subcampanulate, 5-lobed, the lobes in one
series, imbricated in the bud, ovate or oblong, rounded at apex, nearly equal; corolla campanulate,
white, with 5 spreading broad-ovate lobes rounded at apex and furnished on each
side at base with a minute acute ovate or lanceolate appendage; stamens 5; filaments filiform;
anthers ovoid-sagittate, attached on the back below the middle, the cells opening by
subextrorse slits; staminodia petal-like, ovate or ovate-lanceolate, entire or obscurely
denticulate, flattened or keeled on the back, sometimes furnished at base with a pair of
minute scales; ovary hirsute, ovoid to ovoid-conic, gradually or abruptly contracted into a
slender short or elongated simple style stigmatic at the acute apex. Fruit oblong-obovoid
or globose, black, solitary or in 2 or 3-fruited clusters; flesh thin and dry or succulent. Seed
ovoid or oblong, apiculate or rounded at apex, without albumen; seed-coat thick, crustaceous,
light brown, smooth and shining, folded more or less conspicuously on the back into
2 lobes rounded at apex; embryo filling the cavity of the seed; cotyledons thick and fleshy,
hemispheric, usually consolidated; radicle short, turned toward the basilar or subbasilar
orbicular or elliptic hilum.</p>
<p class="tree">Bumelia, with about twenty-five species is confined to the New World, where it is distributed
from the southern United States through the West Indies to Mexico, Central
America, and Brazil. Of the twelve species in the United States which have been distinguished
five are small trees.</p>
<p class="tree">Bumelia produces hard heavy strong wood, that of the North American species containing
bands of numerous large open ducts defining the layers of annual growth and connected
by conspicuous branched groups of similar ducts, presenting in cross-section a reticulate
appearance.</p>

<p class="tree">Avicennia with three species is widely distributed on maritime shores of the tropics of the
two worlds, with one species reaching those of the southern United States. Avicennia produces
hard strong wood. The bark is rich in tannic acid, and is used for tanning leather.
The chief value of these trees is in their ability to live on low tidal shores by the structure
of the embryo, which is growing and ready to take root as soon as it falls into the soft mud,

<p class="tree">Trees or shrubs, with stout branches containing thick white or brown pith, and buds
with several scales. Leaves petiolate, unequally pinnate, deciduous, with serrate or laciniate
leaflets, the base of the petiole naked, glandular or furnished with a stipule-like leaflet;
stipels small, leaf-like, usually setaceous, often 0; stipules small, rudimentary, usually 0
except on vigorous shoots. Flowers small, in broad terminal corymbose cymes, their bracts

<p class="tree">Sambucus with about twenty species is widely and generally distributed through the
temperate parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, and inhabits high mountain ranges
within the tropics, and in Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. Of the nine or ten
North American species three are arborescent. Sambucus possesses cathartic and emetic
properties in the bark; the flowers are excitant and sudorific, and the juice of the fruit is alterative
and laxative. The dried flowers of the European <i>Sambucus nigra</i> L., are used in
the preparation of an aromatic distilled water and in flavoring lard, and the hard and compact
wood is made into combs and mathematical instruments. The large pithy shoots of
Sambucus furnish children with pop-guns, pipes, and whistles; and the fruit of some of the
species is cooked and eaten.</p>
<p class="tree"><i>Sambucus</i>, the name of the Elder-tree, is believed to have been derived from <span title="sambyk&ecirc;" class="g">&sigma;&alpha;&mu;&beta;&#8059;&kappa;&eta;</span>, a
musical instrument, probably in allusion to the use of the pithy stems.</p>
